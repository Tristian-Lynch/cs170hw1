            <h3>Enders Game</h3>
            <p>
                Enders Game is a movie about a kid who is recruited to be
                trained as a leader to fight against an alien army incase of
                another invasion. He excels in his training and is sent to
                command the fleet that is being sent to the aliens home world.
                Towards the end of his training the "simulations" that he was
                doing turned out to be real battles that he was completely
                unaware of. The movie ended on quite a cliffhanger and did not
                recieve a sequel unfortunately.

                fell into some other dimension as he went into a black hole.
                This information he was able to get inside the black hole was
                the key to the gravity propulsion device that the ship on earth
                was using. The time in the black hole moved slower than that
                outside and when he exited the blackhole, his daughter was a lot
                older than him on her deathbed, but she never forgot and knew it
